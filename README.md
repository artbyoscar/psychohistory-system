- **📚 Academic Purpose**: Educational and research use only

### For Real-World Applications
- **❌ Not Investment Advice**: Do not use for financial or business decisions
- **❌ Not Policy Guidance**: Governments should not base decisions on current outputs  
- **❌ Not Crisis Prediction**: Cannot reliably predict specific events or timing
- **❌ No Operational Use**: System needs extensive validation before real-world deployment
- **🔍 Research Only**: All outputs should be treated as experimental research

### Data & Privacy
- **🔒 Synthetic Data**: Most current data is computer-generated for demonstration
- **🌐 Public Sources**: Real data integration limited to publicly available sources
